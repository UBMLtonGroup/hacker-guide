\section{Understanding the GCState}
\label{gcstate}

You will notice that some of the offsets your program uses
are defined at the top of, eg, test.1.c

How are these calculated?

mlton/main/compile.fun search for "Set GC\_state offsets and sizes"

The above function does a look up in a text file (build/lib/targets/self/constants) which is generated by a C program emitted by the "build" function in mlton/main/lookup-constant.fun
